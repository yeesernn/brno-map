      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>The Brno Moment project is a documentary style-photography project documenting moments and things I find interesting and different in the city of Brno. 
        
      It consists of photos that I've taken on a almost daily basis using my phone and camera (of course not all of them made the cut). In a way it is a photo diary and it also showcase the uniqueness of this place, from the perspective of someone coming from another culture. 
       
      It is presented in an interactive "map" style website, allowing the visitor to "explore" the city in an immersive way, like hopping on the tram and go to another part of the city.
