      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>The Brno Moment project is a documentary style photography project of my time spent in the city of Brno during the month of September to January 2024 during my Erasmus stay. It documents a part of the photos that I took of things I found interesting and new to me and what I found different coming from the perspective of another culture. 
        It is presented in an interactive "map" style website, allowing the visitor to explore the city, going from place to place.
